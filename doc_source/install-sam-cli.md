## Installing the AWS SAM CLI<a name="install-sam-cli-instructions"></a>

 To install the AWS SAM CLI, follow the instructions for your operating system\. 

### Linux<a name="install-sam-cli-instructions-linux"></a>

------
#### [ x86\_64 \- command line installer ]

1. Download the [AWS SAM CLI \.zip file](https://github.com/aws/aws-sam-cli/releases/latest/download/aws-sam-cli-linux-x86_64.zip) to a directory of your choice\.

1. **\(Optional\)** You can verify the integrity of the installer before installation\. For instructions, see [Verify the integrity of the AWS SAM CLI installer](reference-sam-cli-install-verify.md)\.

1. Unzip the installation files into a directory of your choice\. The following is an example, using the `sam-installation` subdirectory\.
**Note**  
If your operating system doesn't have the built\-in unzip command, use an equivalent\.

   ```
   $ unzip aws-sam-cli-linux-x86_64.zip -d sam-installation
   ```

1. Install the AWS SAM CLI by running the `install` executable\. This executable is located in the directory used in the previous step\. The following is an example, using the `sam-installation` subdirectory:

   ```
   $ sudo ./sam-installation/install
   ```

1. Verify the installation\.

   ```
   $ sam --version
   ```

   On successful installation, you should see output like the following:

   ```
    SAM CLI, version 1.58.0
   ```

#### [ ARM \- command line installer ]

**To install the AWS SAM CLI**

We recommend installing the AWS SAM CLI into a virtual environment\. This ensures a clean starting environment and an isolated environment when troubleshooting\.
+ To install the AWS SAM CLI into a virtual environment, see [Installing the AWS SAM CLI into a virtual environment using pip](manage-sam-cli-versions.md#manage-sam-cli-versions-install-virtual)\.

After installing the AWS SAM CLI, you can create an alias for the AWS SAM CLI\. This lets you use the AWS SAM CLI outside of your virtual environment\.

**To configure an alias for the AWS SAM CLI**

1. Get the full path to the virtual environment that you installed the AWS SAM CLI into\. The following is an example:

   ```
   (venv)$ pwd
   /home/ec2-user/sam-cli
   ```

1. Create your alias\.

   ```
   $ echo 'alias sam="virtual-environment-directory/venv/bin/sam"' >> ~/.bashrc
   $ source ~/.bashrc
   ```

   The following is an example:

   ```
   $ echo 'alias sam="/home/ec2-user/sam-cli/venv/bin/sam"' >> ~/.bashrc
   $ source ~/.bashrc
   ```

1. Verify your alias\.

   ```
   $ sam --version
   SAM CLI, version 1.81.0
   $ which sam
   alias sam='/home/ec2-user/sam-cli/venv/bin/sam'
           ~/sam-cli/venv/bin/sam
   ```

------
#### [ Homebrew ]

**Important**  
You must have Homebrew installed on your Linux machine\. For install instructions, see [Installing Homebrew to use with the AWS SAM CLI](install-homebrew.md)\.

To install the AWS SAM CLI using Homebrew, run the following command:

```
$ brew install aws/tap/aws-sam-cli
```

Verify the installation\.

```
$ sam --version
```

On successful installation of the AWS SAM CLI, you should see output like the following:

```
SAM CLI, version 1.58.0
```

### macOS<a name="install-sam-cli-instructions-macos"></a>

Install the AWS SAM CLI using its package installer or through Homebrew\. We recommend using the package installer\.

#### Using the package installer<a name="install-sam-cli-instructions-macos-package"></a>

The package installer has two installation methods that you can choose from:

1. GUI

1. Command line

You can install for all users or just your current user\. To install for all users, superuser authorization is required\.

#### Installation steps<a name="install-sam-cli-instructions-macos-steps"></a>

 Install the AWS SAM CLI using any of the following options\.

**To install the AWS SAM CLI**

1.  Determine an installation directory that you have write permissions to\. Then, create an `xml` file using the template and modify it to reflect your installation directory\. The directory must already exist\. 

    For example, if you replace *path\-to\-my\-directory* with `/Users/myUser/Desktop`, the `aws-sam-cli` program folder will be installed there\. 

   ```
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
   <plist version="1.0">
     <array>
       <dict>
         <key>choiceAttribute</key>
         <string>customLocation</string>
         <key>attributeSetting</key>
         <string>path-to-my-directory</string>
         <key>choiceIdentifier</key>
         <string>default</string>
       </dict>
     </array>
   </plist>
   ```

1.  Save the `xml` file and verify that its valid by running the following: 

   ```
   $ installer -pkg path-to-pkg-installer \
   -target CurrentUserHomeDirectory \
   -showChoicesAfterApplyingChangesXML path-to-your-xml-file
   ```

    The output should display the preferences that will be applied to the AWS SAM CLI program\. 

1.  Run the following to install the AWS SAM CLI: 

   ```
   $ installer -pkg path-to-pkg-installer \
   -target CurrentUserHomeDirectory \
   -applyChoiceChangesXML path-to-your-xml-file
   
   # Example output
   installer: Package name is AWS SAM CLI
   installer: choices changes file 'path-to-your-xml-file' applied
   installer: Upgrading at base path base-path-of-xml-file
   installer: The upgrade was successful.
   ```

**To create a symlink**
+  To invoke the AWS SAM CLI with the sam command, you must manually create a symlink between the AWS SAM CLI program and your `$PATH`\. Create your symlink by modifying and running the following command: 

  ```
  $ sudo ln -s /path-to/aws-sam-cli/sam /path-to-symlink-directory/sam
  ```
  +  *sudo* – If your user has write permissions to `$PATH`, sudo is not required\. Otherwise, sudo is required\. 
  +  *path\-to* – Path to where you installed the AWS SAM CLI program\. For example, `/Users/myUser/Desktop`\. 
  +  *path\-to\-symlink\-directory* – Your `$PATH` environment variable\. The default location is `/usr/local/bin`\. 

**To verify a successful installation**
+  Verify that the AWS SAM CLI has properly installed and that your symlink is configured by running: 

  ```
  $ which sam
  /usr/local/bin/sam
  $ sam --version
  SAM CLI, version 1.66.0
  ```

------
#### [ Homebrew ]

**Important**  
You must have Homebrew installed on your machine\. For install instructions, see [Installing Homebrew to use with the AWS SAM CLI](install-homebrew.md)\.

Follow these steps to install the AWS SAM CLI using Homebrew:

```
$ brew install aws/tap/aws-sam-cli
```

Verify the installation:

```
$ sam --version
```

After successful installation of the AWS SAM CLI, you should see output like the following:

```
SAM CLI, version 1.58.0
```

### Windows<a name="install-sam-cli-instructions-windows"></a>

Windows Installer \(MSI\) files are the package installer files for the Windows operating system\.

Follow these steps to install the AWS SAM CLI using the MSI file\.

1. Download the AWS SAM CLI [64\-bit](https://github.com/aws/aws-sam-cli/releases/latest/download/AWS_SAM_CLI_64_PY3.msi)\.
**Note**  
If you use a 32\-bit version of Windows, see [Installing AWS SAM CLI on 32\-bit Windows](important-notes.md#important-notes-32-bit-windows)\.

1. **\(Optional\)** You can verify the integrity of the installer before installation\. For instructions, see [Verify the integrity of the AWS SAM CLI installer](reference-sam-cli-install-verify.md)\. 

1. Verify the installation\.

   After completing the installation, verify it by opening a new command prompt or PowerShell prompt\. You should be able to invoke `sam` from the command line\.

   ```
   sam --version
   ```

   After successful installation of the AWS SAM CLI, you should see output like the following:

   ```
   SAM CLI, version 1.58.0
   ```

1. Enable long paths \(Windows 10 and newer only\)\.
**Important**  
The [AWS SAM CLI app templates repository](https://github.com/aws/aws-sam-cli-app-templates) contains some long file paths which may cause errors when running `sam init` due to Windows 10 MAX\_PATH limitations\. To resolve this issue, the new long paths behavior must be configured\.

   To enable long paths, see [Enable Long Paths in Windows 10, Version 1607, and Later](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation?tabs=powershell#enable-long-paths-in-windows-10-version-1607-and-later) in the *Microsoft Windows App Development Documentation*\.

1. Install Git\.

   To download sample applications using the `sam init` command, you must also install Git\. For instructions, see [Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)\.
