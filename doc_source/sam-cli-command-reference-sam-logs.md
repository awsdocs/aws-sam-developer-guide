# sam logs<a name="sam-cli-command-reference-sam-logs"></a>

Fetches logs that are generated by your Lambda function\.

When your functions are a part of an AWS CloudFormation stack, you can fetch logs by using the function's logical ID when you specify the stack name\.

**Usage:**

```
sam logs [OPTIONS]
```

**Examples:**

```
sam logs -n HelloWorldFunction --stack-name mystack

# Or, you can fetch logs using the function's name.
sam logs -n mystack-HelloWorldFunction-1FJ8PD36GML2Q

# You can view logs for a specific time range using the -s (--start-time) and -e (--end-time) options
sam logs -n HelloWorldFunction --stack-name mystack -s '10min ago' -e '2min ago'

# You can also add the --tail option to wait for new logs and see them as they arrive.
sam logs -n HelloWorldFunction --stack-name mystack --tail

# Use the --filter option to quickly find logs that match terms, phrases or values in your log events.
sam logs -n HelloWorldFunction --stack-name mystack --filter "error"
```
