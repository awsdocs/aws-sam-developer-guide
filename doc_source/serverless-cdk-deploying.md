# Deploying AWS CDK applications<a name="serverless-cdk-deploying"></a>

The AWS SAM CLI doesn't support deploying AWS CDK applications\. Use `cdk deploy` to deploy your application\. For more information, see [AWS CDK Toolkit \(cdk command\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html) in the *AWS Cloud Development Kit \(CDK\) Developer Guide*
