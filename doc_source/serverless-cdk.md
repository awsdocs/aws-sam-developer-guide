# AWS Cloud Development Kit \(CDK\)<a name="serverless-cdk"></a>

You can use the AWS SAM CLI to locally test and build serverless applications defined using the AWS Cloud Development Kit \(CDK\)\. Because the AWS SAM CLI works within the AWS CDK project structure, you can still use the [AWS CDK Toolkit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/cli.html) for creating, modifying, and deploying your AWS CDK applications\.

For information about installing and configuring the AWS CDK, see [Getting started with the AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html) in the *AWS Cloud Development Kit \(CDK\) Developer Guide*\.

**Note**  
The AWS SAM CLI supports AWS CDK v1 starting from version 1\.135\.0 and AWS CDK v2 starting from version 2\.0\.0\.
