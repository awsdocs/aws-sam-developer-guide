# Working with layers<a name="serverless-sam-cli-layers"></a>

The AWS SAM CLI supports applications that include layers\. For more information about layers, see [AWS Lambda layers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html)\.

The following is an example AWS SAM template with a Lambda function that includes a layer:

```
ServerlessFunction:
  Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
  Properties:
    CodeUri: .
    Handler: my_handler
    Runtime: Python3.7
    Layers:
        - <LayerVersion ARN>
```

For more information about including layers in your application, see [AWS::Serverless::Function](sam-resource-function.md)\.

When you invoke your function using one of the sam local CLI subcommands, the layers package of your function is downloaded and cached on your local host\. See the following chart for default cache directory locations\. After the package is cached, the AWS SAM CLI overlays the layers onto a Docker image that's used to invoke your function\. The AWS SAM CLI generates the names of the images it builds, as well as the LayerVersions that are held in the cache\. You can find more details about the schema in the following sections\.

To inspect the overlaid layers, execute the following command to start a bash session in the image that you want to inspect:

```
docker run -it --entrypoint=/bin/bash samcli/lambda:<Tag following the schema outlined in Docker Image Tag Schema> -i
```

**Layer Caching Directory name schema**

Given a LayerVersionArn that's defined in your template, the AWS SAM CLI extracts the LayerName and Version from the ARN\. It creates a directory to place the layer contents in named `LayerName-Version-<first 10 characters of sha256 of ARN>`\.

Example:

```
ARN = arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:layer:myLayer:1
Directory name = myLayer-1-926eeb5ff1
```

**Docker Images tag schema**

To compute the unique layers hash, combine all unique layer names with a delimiter of '\-', take the SHA256 hash, and then take the first 10 characters\.

Example:

```
ServerlessFunction:
  Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
  Properties:
    CodeUri: .
    Handler: my_handler
    Runtime: Python3.7
    Layers:
        - arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:layer:myLayer:1
        - arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:layer:mySecondLayer:1
```

Unique names are computed the same as the Layer Caching Directory name schema:

```
arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:layer:myLayer:1 = myLayer-1-926eeb5ff1
arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:layer:mySecondLayer:1 = mySecondLayer-1-6bc1022bdf
```

To compute the unique layers hash, combine all unique layer names with a delimiter of '\-', take the sha256 hash, and then take the first 25 characters:

```
myLayer-1-926eeb5ff1-mySecondLayer-1-6bc1022bdf = 2dd7ac5ffb30d515926aef
```

Then combine this value with the function's runtime, with a delimiter of '\-':

```
python3.7-2dd7ac5ffb30d515926aefffd
```
