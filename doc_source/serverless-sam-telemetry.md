# Telemetry in the AWS SAM CLI<a name="serverless-sam-telemetry"></a>

At AWS, we develop and launch services based on what we learn from interactions with customers\. We use customer feedback to iterate on our product\. Telemetry is additional information that helps us to better understand our customers’ needs, diagnose issues, and deliver features that improve the customer experience\.

The AWS SAM CLI collects telemetry, such as generic usage metrics, system and environment information, and errors\. For details of the types of telemetry collected, see [Types of Information Collected](#serverless-sam-telemtry-data-collected)\.

The AWS SAM CLI does **not** collect personal information, such as usernames or email addresses\. It also does not extract sensitive project\-level information\.

Customers control whether telemetry is enabled, and can change their settings at any point of time\. If telemetry remains enabled, the AWS SAM CLI sends telemetry data in the background without requiring any additional customer interaction\.

## Disabling Telemetry for a Session<a name="serverless-sam-telemtry-opt-out"></a>

In macOS and Linux operating systems, you can disable telemetry for a single session\. To disable telemetry for your current session, run the following command to set the environment variable `SAM_CLI_TELEMETRY` to `false`\. You must repeat the command for each new terminal or session\. 

```
export SAM_CLI_TELEMETRY=0
```
